                    find a family. The others will continue to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky chance to

                    comfortable
                    (including psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of various
                    skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter staff. Taking care of the animals,
                    they become attached to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone. </div>
